
1. Website:
   - A website is a collection of related web pages and multimedia content that
     are typically organized under a common domain name or URL (Uniform Resource
     Locator). Websites can serve various purposes, such as providing information,
     offering services, or hosting online applications.

2. Webpage:
   - A webpage is a single document or resource on the World Wide Web. It's 
    typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and can include text,
    images, links, multimedia, and other elements. A website is composed of 
    multiple webpages that are linked together.

3. Web Browser:
   - A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and 
    view web content on the internet. It interprets HTML documents and renders
    them as visually formatted webpages. Popular web browsers include Google 
    Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

4. Web Server:
   - A web server is a computer or software application that stores and serves
     web content to users over the internet. It responds to requests from web 
    browsers by sending the requested webpages or resources. Web servers use
    various protocols, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), to facilitate
    communication between clients (web browsers) and the server.

5. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
   - HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages. It consists
   of a set of tags and elements that define the structure and content of 
   a webpage. HTML allows you to format text, insert images, create hyperlinks,
   and structure information using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists,
   and more.

6. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
   - CSS is a stylesheet language used in web development to control the 
   presentation and layout of HTML documents. It separates the content (HTML)
   from the presentation (CSS), allowing web developers to apply styles, 
   such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to web elements. CSS 
   enables the customization and styling of webpages, making them visually 
   appealing and responsive.
